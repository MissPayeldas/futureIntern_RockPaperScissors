🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in Python 🐍
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game project, developed as part of my Python internship with Future Intern! This classic game lets you go head-to-head with the computer in a race to get three in a row.

🛠️ Project Overview
This project is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe Game where the player competes against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to place three of your marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before the computer does! It's a great way to practice game logic and user input validation in Python.

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Gameplay: Alternate turns between the player and computer on a 3x3 grid.
Win & Tie Detection: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.
Input Validation: Ensures the player can only pick valid, unoccupied spots on the grid.
Replay Option: After each round, the player can choose to play again or exit the game
